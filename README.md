# First-Web-Project-Moshified-
I have spent 2 months studying html and css and this is my first web project I am making with these technologys.

Very frustrating and annoying to learn the github repository and im still not sure if its entirely correct, but its
in such a way i can keep track of it.

I will try to learn the proper way to use this after this project, but I'm very eager to get it started and done.
